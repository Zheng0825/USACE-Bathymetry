\subsection{Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE}
We evaluate NRMSE of our methods to measure the difference between the estimated depths and the depths which were actually observed on October 9th (see section~\ref{realData}). The error along the real data for the sandbar is relatively low due to there being less noise within the parameters of the sandbar compared to the error along the 1D transect.
