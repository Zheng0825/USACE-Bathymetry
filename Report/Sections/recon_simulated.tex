\subsection{Estimating Bathymetry}

In this Section, we describe some experimental results with simulated and real data using few existing nonlinear optimization tools that we used in our preliminarily experiments (see Section \ref{inv_techniques}). Note that our forward model is nonlinear as described in Section \ref{forwardproblem} and it can not be written as a matrix equation system. Therefore, in this Bathymetry inversion, we can not use any inverting method where it needs forward operator as a explicit matrix operator (e.g., \verb|tikhonov| and  \verb|lsqnonneg|     
 Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} functions need forward operator as a matrix). Moreover, the bounds of the true Bathymetry range in the interested near shore region is known to be $[0m, 11m]$. Therefore, we picked the inverse solvers that enables us to incorporate that prior knowledge too. 

\subsubsection{Simulated Data}
In this study, Gaussian noise corrupted simulated wave numbers (see Section \ref{Gaussian_noise} for more details) are generated by 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{k}_s = A(\mathbf{h}_t) + \mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2),
\end{equation}
where $A(\cdot)$ represents the nonlinear forward operator defined in Section \ref{forwardproblem}, $\mathbf{h}_t \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ is the true Bathymetry vector, and $\mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2)$ is a additive Gaussian noise vector with standard deviation $\nu$, generated in the Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} by $\nu \cdot $\verb| randn(n,1)|. we manufactured wave numbers $\mathbf{k}_s$ for two different grid resolutions, i.e., 10m and 25m (see Fig. (\ref{Simulated10m}) and (\ref{Simulated25m}) respectively), to test our inverse model before working with actual measurements.

\subsubsection{Bayesian Inference}
The Bayesian inversion approach samples a posterior distribution of depth profiles. For comparison to the other inversion methods, we consider only the depth at each grid point which corresponds to the maximum of the posterior probability distribution at that point. This is achieved by taking the maximum of the kernel density of the estimated depth distribution at each point along the 1D profile. 

This method is first applied using synthetic $k$ input and the resulting depth estimate is shown in Figure~\ref{mcmc-synthetic}. As for other methods, the synthetic result accurately represents the sandbar located at $x~\sim~950~m$ along the profile, which is an important feature to recreate. However, at offshore locations ($x~<~600~m$), the estimation appears to break down. As in other methods, this is expected because of the lower sensitivity of $k$ on $h$ at these depths, a relationship on which our inverse methods rely.

Real $k$ data is then used to estimate the same bathymetry profile (Figure~\ref{mcmc-real}). We find...


Unlike the other methods, the Bayesian approach results in a distribution of depth profiles which optimize $h$ given uncertain $k$. Measurements of wave number, $k$, are not perfect and our resulting distribution of depth profiles translates that uncertainty binto an ensemble of depth estimates which are consistent with the $k$ data to within uncertainty. Figures~\ref{mcmc-posterior-h-synthetic} and \ref{mcmc-posterior-h-real} show the resulting posterior depth distributions. Note that...
