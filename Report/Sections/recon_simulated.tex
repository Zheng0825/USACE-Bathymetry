\subsection{Estimating Bathymetry}

In this Section, we describe some experimental results with simulated and real data using few existing nonlinear optimization tools that we used in our preliminarily experiments (see Section \ref{inv_techniques}). Note that our forward model is nonlinear as described in Section \ref{forwardproblem} and it can not be written as a matrix equation system. Therefore, in this Bathymetry inversion, we can not use any inverting method where it needs forward operator as a explicit matrix operator (e.g., \verb|tikhonov| and  \verb|lsqnonneg|     
 Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} functions need forward operator as a matrix). Moreover, since the bounds of the true Bathymetry is known to be $[0m, 11m]$ 

\subsubsection{Simulated Data}
In this study, Gaussian noise corrupted simulated data (see Section \ref{Gaussian_noise} for more details) is generated by 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{d}_s = A(\mathbf{h}_t) + \mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2),
\end{equation}
where $A(\cdot)$ represents the nonlinear forward operator defines in Section \ref{forwardproblem}, $\mathbf{h}_t \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ is the true Bathymetry vector, and $\mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2)$ is a additive Gaussian noise vector with standard deviation $\nu$, generated in the Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} by $\nu \cdot $\verb| randn(n,1)|.

\subsubsection{Bayesian Inference}
The Bayesian inversion approach samples a posterior distribution of depth profiles. For comparison to the other inversion methods, we consider only the depth at each grid point which corresponds to the maximum of the posterior probability distribution at that point. This is achieved by taking the maximum of the kernel density of the estimated depth distribution at each point along the 1D profile. 

This method is first applied using synthetic $k$ input and the resulting depth estimate is shown in Figure~\ref{mcmc-synthetic}. As for other methods, the synthetic result accurately represents the sandbar located at $x~\sim~950~m$ along the profile, which is an important feature to recreate. However, at offshore locations ($x~<~600~m$), the estimation appears to break down. As in other methods, this is expected because of the lower sensitivity of $k$ on $h$ at these depths, a relationship on which our inverse methods rely.

Real $k$ data is then used to estimate the same bathymetry profile (Figure~\ref{mcmc-real}). We find...


Unlike the other methods, the Bayesian approach results in a distribution of depth profiles which optimize $h$ given uncertain $k$. Measurements of wave number, $k$, are not perfect and our resulting distribution of depth profiles translates that uncertainty binto an ensemble of depth estimates which are consistent with the $k$ data to within uncertainty. Figures~\ref{mcmc-posterior-h-synthetic} and \ref{mcmc-posterior-h-real} show the resulting posterior depth distributions. Note that...
