\subsection{Estimating Bathymetry}

In this Section, we describe some experimental results with simulated and real data using few existing nonlinear optimization tools that we used in our preliminarily experiments (see Section \ref{inv_techniques}). Note that our forward model is nonlinear as described in Section \ref{forwardproblem} and it can not be written as a matrix equation system. Therefore, in this Bathymetry inversion, we can not use any inverting method where it needs forward operator as a explicit matrix operator (e.g., \verb|tikhonov| and  \verb|lsqnonneg|     
 Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} functions need forward operator as a matrix). Moreover, since the bounds of the true Bathymetry is known to be $[0m, 11m]$ 

\subsubsection{Simulated Data}
In this study, Gaussian noise corrupted simulated data (see Section \ref{Gaussian_noise} for more details) is generated by 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{d}_s = A(\mathbf{h}_t) + \mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2),
\end{equation}
where $A(\cdot)$ represents the nonlinear forward operator defines in Section \ref{forwardproblem}, $\mathbf{h}_t \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ is the true Bathymetry vector, and $\mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2)$ is a additive Gaussian noise vector with standard deviation $\nu$, generated in the Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} by $\nu \cdot $\verb| randn(n,1)|.
