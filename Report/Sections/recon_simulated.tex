\subsection{Estimating Bathymetry}

In this Section, we describe some experimental results with simulated and real data using few existing nonlinear optimization tools that we used in our preliminarily experiments (see Section \ref{inv_techniques}). Note that our forward model is nonlinear as described in Section \ref{forwardproblem} and it can not be written as a matrix equation system. Therefore, in this Bathymetry inversion, we can not use any inverting method where it needs forward operator as a explicit matrix operator (e.g., \verb|tikhonov| and  \verb|lsqnonneg|     
 Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} functions need forward operator as a matrix). Moreover, the bounds of the true Bathymetry range in the interested near shore region is known to be $[0m, 11m]$. Therefore, we picked the inverse solvers that enables us to incorporate that prior knowledge too. 

\subsubsection{Simulated Data}
In this study, Gaussian noise corrupted simulated wave numbers (see Section \ref{Gaussian_noise} for more details) are generated by 
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{k}_s = A(\mathbf{h}_t) + \mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2),
\end{equation}
where $A(\cdot)$ represents the nonlinear forward operator defined in Section \ref{forwardproblem}, $\mathbf{h}_t \in \mathbb{R}_+^n$ is the true Bathymetry vector, and $\mathcal{N}(0, \nu^2)$ is a additive Gaussian noise vector with standard deviation $\nu$, generated in the Matlab\textsuperscript{\textregistered} by $\nu \cdot $\verb| randn(n,1)|. we manufactured wave numbers $\mathbf{k}_s$ for two different grid resolutions, i.e., 10m and 25m (see Fig. (\ref{Simulated10m}) and (\ref{Simulated25m}) respectively), to test our inverse model before working with actual measurements.
