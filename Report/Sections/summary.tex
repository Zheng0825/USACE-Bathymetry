We used three different mathematical methods to determine bathymetry based on the relationship between wave number and bathymetry. We chose to use a mathematical approach to estimate depth because waves make it difficult to determine the depth of the ocean physically with technology. Our three methods, nonlinear least squares, Tikhonov, and Bayesian MCMC, proved to have promising results for the estimation of depth given the real wave number data. 


[Need to solve the following problem with priors $\mathbf{h}_p$].

\begin{equation}\label{LS-regBC}
\mathbf{\hat{h}} = \underset{\mathbf{0} \preceq \mathbf{h} \preceq \mathbf{11}}{\arg \min} \ \ \|  \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{h}) -  \mathbf{d} \|_2^2  +  \alpha \| \mathbf{h} -  \mathbf{h}_p\|_2^2,
