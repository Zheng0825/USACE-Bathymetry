\subsection{Boundary Condition}
\label{BC}

	Boundary conditions for this project were collected through a bottom-mounted AWAC profiler located approximately 1150 meters offshore at a depth of 11 meters in Figure 3.%(Figure \ref{AWAC}).

	Vast amounts of wave data has been collected by the AWAC system at the offshore boundary. For the 1-dimensional problem, the forcing condition at this boundary is the significant wave height and peak frequency.
