Data for this project was collected by the US. Army Corps of Engineers Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC) during October 2015 at the Field Research Facility (FRF) in Duck, NC in the Outerbanks.\footnote{The data can be accessed online at http://chlthredds.erdc.dren.mil/thredds/catalog/frf/projects/bathyduck/catalog.html} The data comes from the Bathyduck project conducted by the Coastal and Hydraulic Laboratory (CHL). We make use of information about wave height, wave number, wave period, and bathymetry. These fields combine information collected by the Argus Beach Monitoring System, the Lighter Amphibious Resupply Cargo (LARC-5) vessel, the Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy (CRAB).
