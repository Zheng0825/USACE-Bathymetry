We acknowledge the generous support of SAMSI, NCSU, and the NSF in addition to the workshop organizers including Ilse Ipsen and Thomas Gehrmann. We also appreciate the guidance and patience of our mentors Ty Hesser and Matthew Farthing of the USACE and Lea Jenkins of Clemson University. Anusha Madushani (UC Merced) and Kimberly Kaufeld (NCSU) provided valuable input to the MCMC inversion effort. Finally, we thank the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for providing a novel problem and interesting data from which to start.
