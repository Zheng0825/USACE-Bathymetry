Bathymetry is submarine topography
	-its just a complicated word for topography...but underwater

Knowledge of bathymetry is important for many applications
	-Navigation
		-military and domestic! Landing troops or pleasure crafts
	-Predict flooding and wave conditions during extreme weather events or 
	during landing conditions for troops

Wave Properties
	-Some of these wave properties we can calculate.....

Direction Measurements are expensive and challenging
	-Unfortunately, these measurements are expensive and challenging, so why
	cant we go backwards? Can we input wave surface conditions into the model
	and get the bathymetry back? We could gather surface conditions before big storms! 
	Or before we land at an unknown beach.
