===================================Intro=========================================
-A large portion of the global population lives near the sea.
	-what happens at the ocean matters!
		-rip tides might pull your loved one out to sea
		-coastal flooding might damage your property
		-you or your surfer buddy might want to know the best place to get 
		 barreled 
		-maybe your friend's yacht might run aground during a pleasure
		 cruise!

-What do all these things depend on? Bathymetry!

-If we HAVE the data we can predict behaviour in coastal areas through mathematical
 models....we're good at it!

-Unfortunately, these measurements are difficult to get.
	-we may have to drive this silly boat/truck into the surf! Or this scary
	 looking tower!
	-or, as discussed last week, a poor grad student may have to go out with a
	 pole and hope they don't get washed away!	

-Buuuut due to new technology, it has become easier to get surface measurements! 
	-cameras, UAV's, satellites - WHY NOT INVERT OUR PHYSICS MODELS!?

=================================Flow Chart======================================
-Here is how we invert
	-mention the use of k
=================================Surface Wave Properties ========================
- For this project, the wave properties we are interested in are
	-Wave period (the time between wave peaks)
	-Wave height (the difference between peaks and troughts)
	-Wave length (the length between peaks)
	-Wave Number, or k, essentially the inverse of the wave number or
	 the spatial frequency of waves (number of waves per unit distance - or radians per unit distance)


===============================Data==============================================
-show flow chart
-data collected in Duck, NC...by the USACE
	-our location and Duck
-boundary conditions collected through a AWAC
	- AWAC derives height and period from pressure (piezo resistive), orbital 		velocity (doppler thingy), surface position (reverse echo sounder)
-Argus video data was used to measure wave number (photogrammetry)
-luckily, we have known bathymetry to test our results
	-based on our boundary conditions, we chose the 1d transect
		-unfortunately, we don't data everywhere 
			-interpolation scheme - pchip - shape preserving
			-extrapolation to BC - linear

=============================Forward model=======================================
-Assume linear wave theory
-explain physical interpretation (SAM)

============================Inversion Methods====================================
-Now that we have data and a forward model, we can use them to create an inversion
 scheme for the bathymetry.

-For mathematicians, least squares was an obvious place to start
	-normal least squares (2-norm)
	-minimize the residual
-Baysian MCMC
	-statistical approach
	-gives a distribution of estimates
-Tikonov Regularization (fmincon)
	-for this and most physical problems, we could come up with constraints
 	 on our values for depth.
		-depths greater than zero
		-depths not too large (we are in near shore and know the depth
		 at the BC)
	-multivariate

============================Manufactured Data====================================
-To test these methods, before using real wave number data, we created some
 manufactured data.
	- took real bathymetry -> ran through forward model to get a calculated k
     	 -> added some noise.
	- we then used this data in our three methods to estimate the bathymetry
	  and compare to the input into the forward model.

============================Manufactured Data Results============================


============================Real Data============================================
-As mentioned before, we have measured wave number data for the month of October (2015)
	-to run our inversion schemes, we wanted to use "nice" wave number data
		-characterised by calm conditions; in choppy conditions the linear
		 wave theory breaks down
	-we also wanted to choose a time around available survey data
	-October 9th fit both of these requirements so we plotted k profiles over a ten
	 hour period and identified 22:00:00
		-As can be seen, other profiles around this time still contain considerable
	 	 noise

-With the chosen k data, we implement our inversion scheme!

===========================Results Using Real Data==============================




-Our estimates are limited by noise in the k data and assuming the waves interact 
 the ocean bed. 
	-Although our measured k is close to what we calculated with our forward
	 model, there still appears to be noise
	-As the depth increases, the less influence of the bed rears its ugly head
	-IT IS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THIS METHOD TO CAPTURE THE WHOLE BED PROFILE
		-we know the depth at the boundary condition is 11m

===========================Future Work==========================================
-we've only used k data to assimilate our models; what would happen if we use 
 wave height data captured through Lidar measurements? This improve our estimates
 in deeper water as it incorporates the propogation of energy from the BC

-we explored the Tikonhov Regularization but unfortunately we didn't have time to 
 find the optimum regularization method...this is a promising direction of further
 work.

-explore these methods using 2D wave physics and high fidelity models
