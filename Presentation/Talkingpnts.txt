===================================Intro=========================================
-A large portion of the global population lives near the sea.
	-what happens at the ocean matters!
		-rip tides might pull your loved one out to sea
		-coastal flooding might damage your property
		-you or your surfer buddy might want to know the best place to get 
		 barreled 
		-maybe your friend's yacht might run aground during a pleasure
		 cruise!

-What do all these things depend on? Bathymetry!

-If we HAVE the data we can predict behaviour in coastal areas through mathematical
 models....we're good at it!

-Unfortunately, these measurements are difficult to get.
	-we may have to drive this silly boat/truck into the surf! Or this scary
	 looking tower!
	-or, as discussed last week, a poor grad student may have to go out with a
	 pole and hope they don't get washed away!	

-Buuuut due to new technology, it has become easier to get surface measurements! 
	-cameras, UAV's, satellites - WHY NOT INVERT OUR PHYSICS MODELS!?

=================================Flow Chart======================================
-Here is how we invert
	-mention the use of k
=================================Surface Wave Properties ========================
- For this project, the wave properties we are interested in are
	-Wave period (the time between wave peaks)
	-Wave height (the difference between peaks and troughts)
	-Wave length (the length between peaks)
	-Wave Number, or k, essentially the inverse of the wave number or
	 the spatial frequency of waves (number of waves per unit distance - 
	 or radians per unit distance)


===============================Data==============================================
-show flow chart
-data collected in Duck, NC...by the USACE
	-our location and Duck
-boundary conditions collected through a AWAC
	- AWAC derives height and period from pressure (piezo resistive), orbital 		velocity (doppler thingy), surface position (reverse echo sounder)
-Argus video data was used to measure wave number (photogrammetry)
-luckily, we have known bathymetry to test our results
	-based on our boundary conditions, we chose the 1d transect
		-unfortunately, we don't data everywhere 
			-interpolation scheme - pchip - shape preserving
			-extrapolation to BC - linear

=============================Forward model=======================================
-Assume linear wave theory
-explain physical interpretation (SAM)

============================Inversion Methods====================================
-Now that we have data and a forward model, we can use them to create an inversion
 scheme for the bathymetry.

-For mathematicians, least squares was an obvious place to start
	-normal least squares (2-norm)
	-minimize the residual
-Baysian MCMC
	-statistical approach
	-gives a distribution of estimates
-Tikonov Regularization (fmincon)
	-for this and most physical problems, we could come up with constraints
 	 on our values for depth.
		-depths greater than zero
		-depths not too large (we are in near shore and know the depth
		 at the BC)
	-multivariate

============================Manufactured Data====================================
-To test these methods, before using real wave number data, we created some
 manufactured data.
	- took real bathymetry -> ran through forward model to get a calculated k
     	 -> added some noise.
	- we then used this data in our three methods to estimate the bathymetry
	  and compare to the input into the forward model.

============================Manufactured Data Results============================
-so I'll address the elephant in the room - in the deeper parts things looks a bit odd.
-but in fact, we are interested in the dynamic portions of the bathymetry and this
 happens to be in the near shore! The sand bar! This is the are that changes the most
 and as you can see, we captured these well with all three of our methods! 

-so with this success, we decided to move on the real data

============================Real Data============================================
-As mentioned before, we have measured wave number data for the month of October (2015)
	-to run our inversion schemes, we wanted to use "nice" wave number data
		-characterised by calm conditions; in choppy conditions the linear
		 wave theory breaks down
	-we also wanted to choose a time around available survey data
	-October 9th fit both of these requirements so we plotted k profiles over a ten
	 hour period and identified 22:00:00
		-As can be seen, other profiles around this time still contain considerable
	 	 noise

-With the chosen k data, we implement our inversion scheme!

===========================Results Using Real Data==============================





==========================Limitations==========================================

-Our estimates are limited by noise in the k data and assuming the waves interact 
 the ocean bed. 
	-Although our measured k is close to what we calculated with our forward
	 model, there still appears to be noise
		-if we calculate noise according to the k calculated by our forward
		 there is 40% noise
	-As the depth increases, the less influence of the bed rears its ugly head
	-IT IS UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THIS METHOD TO CAPTURE THE WHOLE BED PROFILE
		-we know the depth at the boundary condition is 11m

-look at our calculated k...as the depth gets larger, k begins to level off,
 it becomes nearly constant. There is less influence from the depth.

===========================Future Work==========================================
-Non-linear wave theory
	-linear wave theory is only a starting point; the point of this work is
	 to act as a building block for future work
	-there are other formulations of the wave theory that links wave height
	 to the dispersion relation

-we've only used k data to assimilate our models; we could improve estimates using
 additional observations!
	-this method will allow for incorporation of wave heights and known
	 bathy.

-due to time constraints, we heurisitcally tuned our regularization
	-a logical next step would be to incorporate prior knowledge of 
	 stable beach profiles or chart data in stable regions

-as discussed, our results were limited by noise in the data, maybe another k
 profile near the same time stamp doesn't have noise there (but it other places)
	-we could incorporate a quantification of "noise" and snap through time


-explore these methods using 2D wave physics
	-this would allow us to create a 2-dimensional representation of the
	 bathy.
